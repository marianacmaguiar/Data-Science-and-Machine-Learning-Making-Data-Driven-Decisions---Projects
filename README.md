    <h1>MIT IDSS Data Science and Machine Learning Certification Projects</h1>
    <p>This repository contains the three graded projects completed during the "Data Science and Machine Learning: Making Data-Driven Decisions" certification by MIT IDSS. Below is a brief overview of each project:</p>
    
 <h2>Pima Diabetes Analysis - Foundations of Data Science</h2>
<p>In this project, we analyzed diabetes data and addressed some important business problems/questions. The project focused on Exploratory Data Analysis. The goal was to analyze different aspects of diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe. The project was completed as a part of the Foundations of Data Science module.</p>

<h2>Movie Recommendation System - Recommendation Systems</h2>
<p>In this project, we built various recommendation systems using different techniques such as Rank-based and Collaborative Filtering-based recommendation systems. The goal was to recommend movies to users. The project was completed as a part of the Recommendation Systems module.</p>

<h2>NYC Taxi Ride Duration Prediction - Predictive Analytics</h2>
<p>In this project, we applied different techniques of Feature engineering and did prediction engineering to build a predictive model for predicting the duration for taxi rides. We used automated feature engineering to create new features. The project was completed as a part of the Predictive Analytics module.</p>
